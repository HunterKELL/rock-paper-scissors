## Project: Fire Grass Water 
Implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).
Originally was made to be played in the browser console.
First project using HTML/CSS/JS together.
#### Things I learned: 
- Better understanding on how functions work.
- Learned how to use the browser console.
- I need to improve my CSS.
- Had fun implementing the functions, felt good when I got something working.
- Still a lot to learn
